		<summary>Background</summary>
		<p>Hamilton was born in Stevenage, England, a town about 30 miles (48 km) north of London. He began his racing career when he was eight years old. He won the British Kart Championship when he was 10. Three years later Hamilton was signed to the McLaren and Mercedes-Benz Young Driver Support Programme, where he was given the support and backing he needed to train and develop his skills. From 1998 to 2000 he won European and world karting championships, and at age 15 he became the youngest-ever driver to be ranked number one in the sport.</p>

			<summary>Background</summary>
			<p>He had his first run in a kart thanks to childhood friend Jules Bianchi. Leclerc, the younger of the pair by seven years, showed similar skills at the wheel and followed his friend’s path towards F1.

			In 2009 Leclerc became the youngest-ever winner of France’s cadet karting championship. Two years later Nicolas Todt, Bianchi’s manager, signed Leclerc up. This was a pivotal moment, as without Todt’s backing Leclerc doubted his family could have afforded to keep supporting him.</p>
